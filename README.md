# csvReader

This program is to read a csv file, sort whatever the bad data is out, log the count of total number of records recieved, total number of records successful, and total number of records failed.  It also imports all sucessful records into a db file.

In order to run csvReader:
1.  JRE (java 8 update 231)
2.  JDK (java SE development kit update 231)
3.  sqlite driver (sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar)

1. I ran this program in the BlueJ development enviroment.  The program was split into seveal distinct steps, outlined as such, and then generalized so as to fit all possible data types and requirements.  Defined variables were used to example general computations, and ultimetly, the generalized method was formalized.
